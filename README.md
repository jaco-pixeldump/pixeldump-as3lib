# pixeldump-as3lib
as3 general purpose classes collection

## abstract
every dev uses his own libs for daily work, this is just one of these, here an incomplete feature list:

* (very) partial as3 tag support reading / generation
* file loader/writer helper
* tiny custom tween engine
* graphic engine with svg "d" node support, svg font glyphs, xml theming
* sound lib with wav write/read
* (old draft) musicXML file format reader
* misc utils

it may compile to .swc (just exclude some classes in mk due to its draft state), or link to own code.

hope to have time for docs some days.

:)
